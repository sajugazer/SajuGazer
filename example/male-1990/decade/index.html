        <div style="max-width:420px;margin:40px auto;padding:20px;background:rgba(255,255,255,0.85);border-radius:15px;color:#000;font-size:0.92rem;line-height:1.8;">
            <h1 style="font-size:1.3rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:12px;">Decade Fortune — Male, Jan 1, 1990</h1>
            <p style="font-size:0.85rem;color:#555;margin-bottom:16px;"><strong>Gender:</strong> Male · <strong>Date:</strong> January 1, 1990 · <strong>Time:</strong> 12:00 · <strong>Location:</strong> Busan</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">Decade Luck - age 28</h2>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">Overall Evaluation</h2>
            <p>Attention turns away from outward activity and toward intellectual and professional mastery. Immersing yourself in a single field allows true expertise to emerge, often accompanied by philosophical or spiritual Birth. With stillness prevailing, maintaining what you have proves wiser than pursuing dramatic change.</p>
            <p>This is your prime period, building unrivaled status and wealth as the leader who heads a family or an organization.</p>
            <p>Even starting from nothing, you achieve monumental success and become a leader of a family, organization, or entire field.</p>
            <p>A period of awakening to unseen realms or completing a body of unparalleled specialized knowledge.</p>
            <p>A period of playing a central role within an organization, gaining prestige, and leading a stable life within social systems. A strong attachment to honor may confine you within rigid boundaries, so allowing yourself occasional freedom of thought is beneficial.</p>
            <p>Over this ten-year period, you steadily accumulate assets through diligence and achieve solid economic independence. Be mindful that focusing solely on money may make life feel monotonous or rigid, so nurturing spiritual and emotional richness is equally important.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">About Love</h2>
            <p>This is a long stretch defined by inward depth rather than social activity. Reflection on relationships intensifies, and preference shifts toward meaningful dialogue with a small circle rather than broad social engagement. As detachment can grow, keeping basic lines of communication open is essential.</p>
            <p>You become the pillar of the household, taking responsibility for and leading your partner, while building a stable family that gains social recognition.</p>
            <p>Whether positive or negative, you may form a connection you will never forget. However, extreme mental sensitivity can lead to nervous exhaustion or repeated breakups.</p>
            <p>A flow of maintaining a moral and upright view of relationships and sustaining a stable family protected by law.</p>
            <p>You meet a sincere partner, build a family, and maintain a financially comfortable and stable romantic life.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">About Wealth</h2>
            <p>Long-term dedication to a single field receives economic recognition, with knowledge and expertise solidifying into lasting assets.</p>
            <p>You rise to become the top authority in a field, accumulating immense wealth and assuming responsibility for the assets of a family or organization.</p>
            <p>Legitimate assets acquired by observing law and order protect you, and social credibility itself becomes wealth.</p>
            <p>Assets accumulated step by step become a strong pillar, completing your journey toward economic independence in this most practical phase.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">About Society</h2>
            <p>Roles requiring sustained focus—such as research, technical work, or analytical disciplines—bring notable success. Quiet environments that allow deep concentration suit you best, leading to higher evaluations and academic or professional achievement.</p>
            <p>As a core pillar of the organization, you exercise strong leadership and authority, clearly establishing hierarchical order and leading members in unified action toward shared goals as the head figure.</p>
            <p>By complying with laws and rules and demonstrating exemplary conduct, you achieve rapid promotion or gain honor within an organization. Although you are highly optimized for systems, a lack of flexibility may lead to communication breakdowns with colleagues if you adhere only to principles, so adaptability is required.</p>
            <p>You become a symbol of diligence who faithfully fulfills assigned responsibilities, earning a reputation as the most reliable worker or student in the organization. While your meticulous approach reduces mistakes, you may be viewed as conservative for prioritizing stability over change or innovation.</p>
