            <h1 style="font-size:1.3rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:12px;">Saju Total Analysis — Male, Jan 1, 1990</h1>
            <p style="font-size:0.85rem;color:#555;margin-bottom:16px;"><strong>Gender:</strong> Male · <strong>Date:</strong> January 1, 1990 · <strong>Time:</strong> 12:00 · <strong>Location:</strong> Busan</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">About Personality</h2>
            <p>Bright and passionate like the sun, you possess honesty that reveals yourself without concealment and lively sociability. Overflowing with energy that illuminates the world, you draw attention wherever you go, yet your emotions can flare up and cool down easily, and at times an overly strong sense of self may tire those around you.</p>
            <p>With the spirit of a tiger, you possess strong independence and powerful drive. Gifted with leadership, you prefer carving your own path rather than following others. Your chivalrous nature compels you to stand up for those in need, reflecting a bold and passionate character.</p>
            <p>With a strong Fire element, you radiate bright, sun-like energy that energizes those around you. Open and straightforward, you are widely welcomed, and when given a role, you pour your entire heart into it with fiery passion.</p>
            <p>Lacking the Metal element, you have a gentle and warm disposition, making interpersonal relationships smooth and harmonious. With deep sensitivity and compassion that embraces others' pain as your own, you naturally attract people and enjoy abundant relational goodwill.</p>
            <p>You possess exceptionally strong autonomy, unbreakable independence, and pride that withstands any adversity. However, your stubbornness can lead you to dismiss others' advice, and excessive competitiveness may cause unnecessary friction, giving you a lone-wolf tendency.</p>
            <p>Your words and actions are well-balanced and wise, and you excel at expressing your thoughts clearly and logically to others. You know how to enjoy life's pleasures without crossing the line, and through diligence and steady movement, you actively create abundance for yourself as a highly productive individual.</p>
            <p>You may be weak in fine finishing details or numerical calculations, leaving outcomes slightly incomplete, and you may act based more on principles or emotions than practical gain. Your sense of direction can be somewhat blurred, leading to strong starts but weaker conclusions, yet your pure, uncalculating humanity is a distinct charm. Make budgeting a daily habit and set concrete short-term goals.</p>
            <p>You possess strong self-discipline combined with flexibility, making you well-suited for roles as a middle manager or leader within an organization. With a clear distinction between public and private matters and a strong sense of justice, you earn the trust of those around you. You are wise enough to pursue both social status and personal happiness at the same time.</p>
            <p>You are wise and thoughtful, with an exceptional ability to absorb new knowledge like a sponge and make it your own. You maintain a strong balance between emotion and reason, allowing you to empathize with the pain of others while offering objective advice. You are a person of refined character and dignity.</p>
            <p>You are highly positive and energetic, possessing a charm that naturally draws the affection of those around you. Your learning ability is outstanding, and this is a phase in which independence and the drive to stand on your own begin to emerge.</p>
            <p>You possess extremely intense energy, unmatched stubbornness, and an unbreakable sense of pride. Like a warrior, you push through any adversity head-on with overwhelming force.</p>
            <p>Blessed with the gentle virtue of the moon, you are compassionate and broad-minded. With a strong inclination toward harmony, you avoid conflict and naturally bring peace to those around you.</p>
            <p>Like a soft crimson glow, you possess an irresistible charm and natural sweetness that draws people in. You excel at creating warmth and likability, effortlessly winning affection from others.</p>
            <p>You carry the energy that governs both beginnings and endings. With strong willpower and perseverance, you are driven to rise through self-made success and stand at the very top of your field or lineage.</p>
            <p>You possess captivating charm that draws others' attention and an abundance of artistic talent. With rich sensitivity and a natural gift for cultivating your image, you carry a glamorous energy that thrives on public popularity.</p>
            <p>You are born into an intense destiny of taking and being taken, marked by fierce competitiveness and strong ambition. A powerful will that does not bend under external pressure defines your core strength.</p>
            <p>You have a sensitive constitution, keen intuition, and highly developed spiritual perception. Thought tends to precede action, and at times you may enjoy solitude or show a disposition toward exploring religious or philosophical depth.</p>
            <p>An energy that moves diligently across the earth, you enjoy change and possess exceptionally strong activity and mobility. You have a strong will to carve out your own path, with broad interpersonal networks and a sociable nature.</p>
            <p>Carrying the meaning of collision and shattering, you possess highly dynamic and ever-changing energy. Rather than settling for the status quo, you constantly challenge reality with a reformist mindset and powerful drive for improvement.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">About Success</h2>
            <p>Bright energy and candid expression become the keys to success, capturing the hearts of the public and leading the atmosphere of organizations as you grow. However, you must beware of rashness that ignores consequences; if you only pour out your fire without control, you may burn out before seeing true results.</p>
            <p>Your explosive energy and presence can overwhelm others, but because you burn fast and intensely, follow-through and emotional control are crucial. Mastering restraint and composure protects your reputation and achievements.</p>
            <p>Without the Metal element, you may struggle to refuse others' requests, wasting time and energy. Authority and success emerge when you clearly separate personal and professional boundaries, cultivate firmness, and act according to your own principles.</p>
            <p>You shine brightest when building your own business or establishing an independent professional domain rather than working under others. If you let go of stubborn independence and learn to share success with colleagues, you can evolve into a powerful organizational leader.</p>
            <p>With a strong balance of planning and execution, you are recognized as a reliable hands-on professional in almost any field, particularly excelling in technical or service-oriented roles. Your genuine warmth and care for others return as goodwill, bringing crucial support at decisive moments.</p>
            <p>Rather than being swayed by immediate results, you are more likely to find peace of mind and success in fields such as research, art, or service, where the process itself is valued. Keeping a partner nearby who can support completion while you focus on ideas or technical development is advantageous for creating unique value.</p>
            <p>Valuing honor and walking the righteous path is your greatest strategy for success, and trust-based relationships become powerful assets at critical moments in life. Your ability to exercise rational leadership and guide teams toward success makes it highly likely that you will become a core talent in a large organization.</p>
            <p>Building upon the virtue of elders and academic achievement, you steadily develop a solid professional career and earn public respect as an educator or advisor. You have a strong sense for applying acquired knowledge effectively in practice, playing the role of a strategist within organizations and walking a smooth path of success based on personal virtue.</p>
            <p>Opportunities arise when you actively present your own appeal. By choosing strong role models, your speed of learning becomes unmatched. You receive support well from those around you, and popularity works in your favor.</p>
            <p>You excel in bold, high-risk tasks, advanced technical fields, or professions dealing with life-and-death situations. When your powerful energy is channeled into public or mission-driven work, great success follows. However, unchecked arrogance can lead to downfall, so constant self-discipline is essential. Never fear hardship—trials are part of your path.</p>
            <p>You possess the power to turn misfortune into good fortune, achieving steady success without major disasters. The kindness you extend to others eventually returns as great luck—practice generosity.</p>
            <p>You shine in service, arts, entertainment, or marketing by using your personal charm as a powerful asset. When you trust your instinctive ability to move people's hearts, significant success follows.</p>
            <p>Consistency and unwavering commitment are the keys to success. Early struggles may arise, but those who persist to the end ultimately gain major recognition or institutional rewards.</p>
            <p>The key lies in your ability to turn your personal appeal into a brand. You can display an unrivaled presence in people-centered fields such as broadcasting, the arts, or service industries.</p>
            <p>Bold and decisive judgment that keeps you one step ahead of others is essential. Use competition as fuel for Birth, but if you master the art of not making enemies, you can amass great wealth.</p>
            <p>You demonstrate strong capability in unseen services or knowledge-based industries, as well as in counseling and medical fields. By honoring ancestors properly or attaining peace of mind through prayer, matters that were once blocked tend to resolve smoothly.</p>
            <p>Frequent movement and change become the foundation of your success. You stand out in careers that require constant activity—such as sales, promotion, or trade—and you possess outstanding abilities in publicizing and spreading your name widely.</p>
            <p>Courage to embrace change is your greatest weapon. You achieve outstanding success in careers that break stagnation and open new paths (sales, restructuring, athletics, investigation, construction).</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">About Love</h2>
            <p>You love with passion that blazes openly like the sun, and your greatest charm lies in infusing vitality into your partner's daily life through your innate optimism and radiance. Your clean-cut, grudge-free nature is a strength, yet when emotions intensify, impulsiveness may burden your partner, and your tendency to heat up quickly and cool just as fast must be restrained to build lasting trust.</p>
            <p>You pursue love that ignites at first sight, but when emotions flare, harsh words may slip out and cause wounds. Regulating emotional intensity is key to maintaining a peaceful relationship.</p>
            <p>Without the Metal element, you may cling to relationships you know should end, unable to let go due to emotional attachment, continuing draining love until exhaustion leads to doubt about love itself. You benefit from a principled, decisive partner with clear personal standards. Someone who helps compensate for your difficulty in setting boundaries—who distinguishes right from wrong clearly and decisively organizes complex situations—can restore order and balance to your life.</p>
            <p>You act as a reliable pillar for your partner, but conflicts may arise from possessiveness or forcing your own ways. Learning the virtue of yielding, respecting your partner's independence, and avoiding pride battles are key to long-lasting relationships. Partners with patience, flexibility, and emotional breadth suit you best.</p>
            <p>Through thoughtful consideration and gentle affection, you bring joy to your partner and resolve conflicts smoothly through conversation. With well-timed humor and expressions of love, you keep the relationship lively and are blessed with a partnership where spouses live joyfully like close friends.</p>
            <p>You may appear awkward or reserved in romance, or fail to fully understand your partner's practical struggles, leading to misunderstandings, but once you give your heart, your sincerity remains unwavering. Practicing small gestures such as remembering anniversaries or offering practical help, and expressing warmth by acknowledging your partner's efforts, will deepen the relationship. A partner with strong economic sense, practical life skills, and realistic judgment suits you best. Since your ability to finalize practical matters or achieve economic stability may be uncertain, you synergize well with a realistic partner who can manage details and help produce tangible results.</p>
            <p>You are a dependable partner who provides trust and stability, leading relationships with a strong sense of responsibility. By upholding each other's social dignity while maintaining warmth and affection at home, you tend to experience very high satisfaction in married life.</p>
            <p>You place the highest value on intellectual connection, becoming a deep place of rest for your partner through warm and considerate love. You are skilled at recognizing and encouraging your partner's strengths, nurturing a beautiful relationship founded on deep trust through continual efforts to understand one another.</p>
            <p>You shine by your very existence and are blessed with drawing love and attention from those around you. Thanks to your positive and cheerful energy, favorable connections never cease, and you may meet a partner like a benefactor who genuinely cherishes you and guides you along the right path, elevating your life to a higher level. Naturally adept at giving and receiving love, romance becomes a source of vitality in your life and an energy that builds a harmonious family.</p>
            <p>Your love burns fiercely and you tend to lead relationships, but an overly strong ego can hurt your partner. Learning gentler communication is the key to maintaining lasting love.</p>
            <p>Even when conflict arises, you handle it wisely before it escalates. Your warm and reassuring presence creates a harmonious and peaceful home life.</p>
            <p>You fall in love easily and can quickly capture someone's heart, but relationships may become complicated. Focusing on one person with care and discernment is crucial.</p>
            <p>You value loyalty deeply and take full responsibility for relationships once they are formed. Your love grows heavier and more profound as time passes.</p>
            <p>With many temptations around you, your romantic life can become complicated, making self-restraint essential.</p>
            <p>In relationships, strong possessiveness may lead to conflict, so conscious consideration and restraint are necessary.</p>
            <p>You seek mental and emotional support from your partner and may engage in a somewhat sensitive form of love.</p>
            <p>You enjoy romance dynamically, with long-distance relationships or encounters during travel occurring frequently.</p>
            <p>You tend to fall passionately at first sight, with relationships that flare up quickly and cool just as fast. Instead of avoiding conflict, you prefer working things out through direct confrontation and dialogue. Active, energetic dates bring vitality to your relationships.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">About Wealth</h2>
            <p>Your strong competitive drive brings many opportunities to earn big money, but impulsive spending and losses through partnerships or financial dealings are common, making careful management essential.</p>
            <p>Your income grows steadily through diligent effort, and with a good sense for financial management and investment, you are able to build assets in a stable and reliable way.</p>
            <p>Neglect in money management can lead to significant financial leakage, so it is safest to establish automatic transfers or savings systems by force and entrust major investments to professionals.</p>
            <p>By managing regular income wisely, you steadily build stable wealth, and as your reputation grows, financial fortune naturally follows.</p>
            <p>You possess favorable inheritance fortune or document-related wealth, along with an outstanding ability to generate significant profits by leveraging intellectual assets.</p>
            <p>You possess an overall upward trajectory in financial fortune. With strong independence and learning ability, you have the power to generate wealth on your own, and you are especially blessed to see your assets take a step up in scale each time you begin something new.</p>
            <p>Wealth often comes through people, making relationship management directly tied to financial gain.</p>
            <p>Even if temporary losses occur, you have luck that allows you to gain large profits all at once through unexpected opportunities.</p>
            <p>Wealth often comes not through direct personal effort, but through support from others or inheritance.</p>
            <p>Wealth accumulates the more busily you move, and you are born with the fortune of building success through your own efforts.</p>
