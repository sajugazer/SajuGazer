            <p style="font-size:0.85rem;color:#555;margin-bottom:16px;"><strong>Gender:</strong> Female · <strong>Date:</strong> December 3, 2000 · <strong>Time:</strong> 04:00 · <strong>Location:</strong> Busan</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">Overall Evaluation</h2>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">About Personality</h2>
            <p>Like a flexible vine or grass, you have exceptional adaptability to your environment and carry resilient vitality within your softness. Your sociability allows for smooth interpersonal relationships and excellent practical sense, yet you must be wary of thoughts that can be easily swayed by surroundings or tendencies toward dependence.</p>
            <p>Like a gentle and peaceful sheep, you possess a strong spirit of sacrifice and deep affection. Though outwardly soft, an inner blade of decisiveness lies within. With a strong sense of community, you maintain harmony while quietly securing your own substance.</p>
            <p>With a strong Earth element, you embody the generosity of vast land, embracing people with stability and trustworthiness. You value loyalty deeply and take responsibility for relationships once formed, projecting a steady and dependable presence.</p>
            <p>You possess a well-balanced sense of self, overflowing with confidence while knowing how to harmonize with others. You enjoy healthy competition, remain independent without becoming isolated, and show strong social flexibility by cooperating when necessary.</p>
            <p>Your words and actions are well-balanced and wise, and you excel at expressing your thoughts clearly and logically to others. You know how to enjoy life's pleasures without crossing the line, and through diligence and steady movement, you actively create abundance for yourself as a highly productive individual.</p>
            <p>You possess excellent realism and a strong goal-oriented mindset, with quick judgment that allows you to secure practical gains efficiently. However, excessive fixation on results may cause you to miss the joy of the process, and overly calculating decisions can lead to emotional isolation or physical exhaustion.</p>
            <p>You possess strong self-discipline combined with flexibility, making you well-suited for roles as a middle manager or leader within an organization. With a clear distinction between public and private matters and a strong sense of justice, you earn the trust of those around you. You are wise enough to pursue both social status and personal happiness at the same time.</p>
            <p>You are wise and thoughtful, with an exceptional ability to absorb new knowledge like a sponge and make it your own. You maintain a strong balance between emotion and reason, allowing you to empathize with the pain of others while offering objective advice. You are a person of refined character and dignity.</p>
            <p>This is a stage of Birth sustained by nourishment within the mother's womb. Your temperament is gentle and well-rounded, allowing you to get along smoothly with those around you. You possess deep consideration for others, and a calm, unhurried composure is a defining trait.</p>
            <p>Like the leading star of the Big Dipper, you possess a dominant leadership nature, sharp intelligence, and extraordinary decisiveness. Your overwhelming charisma and authority naturally command the crowd.</p>
            <p>You possess a driving instinct that cannot remain in one place and constantly seeks motion. Your curiosity for new things is strong, your adaptability is excellent, and you have a broad, expansive view of the world.</p>
            <p>A destiny that follows the will of Heaven, marked by high pride and an aspiration toward noble character. At times life may feel determined more by circumstances than personal will, yet spiritual intuition is strong.</p>
            <p>You are characterized by boldness and frankness, expressing yourself without concealment. You carry strong energy that draws attention from others, and at times you also possess shrewdness that prioritizes practical gain over appearances.</p>
            <p>Literally meaning to conceal brilliance, this signifies the energy of a solitary artist who cultivates an inner spiritual world. You are intelligent and versatile, possessing an introverted charisma that draws inspiration through time spent alone.</p>
            <p>Carrying an energy of resentment without clear cause, you possess a complex psyche where inner conflict, love, and hatred intersect. Highly sensitive and delicate, you are keenly aware of others' perceptions, and this also grants you strong empathy.</p>
            <p>Like spirits passing in and out of a gate, you possess extraordinary intuition and extreme emotional sensitivity. You have a powerful capacity for fixation and deep immersion, carrying a unique inner world that oscillates between genius and madness.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">About Success</h2>
            <p>Flexibility and tenacious vitality become the keys to success, enabling you to survive even the harshest environments and produce solid, tangible results. However, dependence without self-direction must be guarded against; if you lose your own color by being swept along by others, you may ultimately remain merely a tool for others.</p>
            <p>Your strength lies in persistence and reliability, but resisting change can cause missed opportunities. Breaking fixed patterns and adopting flexibility opens the door to greater wealth and success.</p>
            <p>You excel at building relationships and seizing opportunities through networks, combined with strong execution that turns intention into action. Setting realistic goals through objective self-assessment and persistently pushing them through is the key to your success.</p>
            <p>With a strong balance of planning and execution, you are recognized as a reliable hands-on professional in almost any field, particularly excelling in technical or service-oriented roles. Your genuine warmth and care for others return as goodwill, bringing crucial support at decisive moments.</p>
            <p>With a sharp eye for the flow of money, you excel in finance, distribution, or business, but must practice focus and avoid spreading yourself too thin. True success comes from regulating greed, prioritizing health, and building long-term trust rather than chasing immediate profits.</p>
            <p>Valuing honor and walking the righteous path is your greatest strategy for success, and trust-based relationships become powerful assets at critical moments in life. Your ability to exercise rational leadership and guide teams toward success makes it highly likely that you will become a core talent in a large organization.</p>
            <p>Building upon the virtue of elders and academic achievement, you steadily develop a solid professional career and earn public respect as an educator or advisor. You have a strong sense for applying acquired knowledge effectively in practice, playing the role of a strategist within organizations and walking a smooth path of success based on personal virtue.</p>
            <p>Growing through the support of those around you and cultivating personal networks are your greatest strengths. You are also particularly suited to step-by-step, incremental Birth.</p>
            <p>You achieve greatness not by serving under others, but by leading organizations yourself or holding authority as a top-level professional. Your fate swings between extremes, so set bold ambitions and advance without hesitation.</p>
            <p>The wider your range of activity becomes, the greater your chances of success. Overseas sales, transportation, distribution, and telecommunications are favorable, and moving through the field rather than staying still is the key to drawing in wealth.</p>
            <p>You must wait humbly for opportunities bestowed by Heaven. Great achievement is found in spiritual fields such as education, religion, or philosophy, and there are many cases of benefiting from the virtue of superiors.</p>
            <p>Opportunities arise when you boldly reveal your expertise to the world. You have the ability to turn disgrace into notoriety, making fields where your name becomes known—such as entertainment, politics, or public speaking—advantageous.</p>
            <p>You achieve unparalleled accomplishments in creative fields such as culture, art, and scholarship. With an exceptional ability to recreate the past, you excel in retro-style ventures or in modernizing traditional techniques.</p>
            <p>Apply your ability to finely read human emotions to counseling, service work, or literature. When you lower expectations of others and focus on yourself, relationships naturally ease and success follows.</p>
            <p>Channel your ability to perceive what others cannot into art, religion, psychology, or highly advanced precision-based fields. The 'power of immersion'—transforming mental noise into creativity—becomes the force that leads you to great achievement.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">About Love</h2>
            <p>You possess delicacy in responding sensitively to your partner's moods and environment, radiating a gentle and flexible charm that offers comfortable companionship. Your resilient vitality supports cherishing and sustaining connections, yet when relationships waver, you may project your own anxiety onto your partner or rely too heavily on them, causing exhaustion. Learning to stand on your own is necessary.</p>
            <p>Once you commit to love, your devotion is unwavering. However, your reserved nature and lack of emotional expression may leave your partner feeling lonely, so small gestures of affection help deepen the bond.</p>
            <p>You can offer both the comfort of a close friend and the excitement of a romantic partner, pursuing an equal relationship built on mutual respect. With calm, uncluttered communication free from emotional excess or obsession, you are likely to maintain a healthy and stable relationship.</p>
            <p>Through thoughtful consideration and gentle affection, you bring joy to your partner and resolve conflicts smoothly through conversation. With well-timed humor and expressions of love, you keep the relationship lively and are blessed with a partnership where spouses live joyfully like close friends.</p>
            <p>You are popular and charming in relationships, but evaluating partners by conditions or attempting to possess them can hinder genuine emotional bonds. When you realize that emotional connection matters more than material abundance and show sincere, uncalculated affection, you can build a stable family. Partners who value mental depth and planning suit you well—those who help slow your pace, balance work-driven tendencies, and guide you toward essential happiness.</p>
            <p>You are a dependable partner who provides trust and stability, leading relationships with a strong sense of responsibility. By upholding each other's social dignity while maintaining warmth and affection at home, you tend to experience very high satisfaction in married life.</p>
            <p>You place the highest value on intellectual connection, becoming a deep place of rest for your partner through warm and considerate love. You are skilled at recognizing and encouraging your partner's strengths, nurturing a beautiful relationship founded on deep trust through continual efforts to understand one another.</p>
            <p>You experience a devoted form of love, either receiving warm care from those around you or tending to a partner with wholehearted dedication. Throughout life, relationships tend to remain calm and peaceful without major upheavals, and over time, mutual trust deepens, forming a sense of comfort akin to family that becomes the core of the bond. Rather than fleeting sparks, you are inclined toward a quietly glowing warmth, carrying a stable romantic fortune that supports the building of a peaceful household.</p>
            <p>Your competitive nature can cause frequent conflicts in relationships, as you dislike yielding even to your partner. While you may be a commander outside, flexibility and emotional disarmament at home are essential.</p>
            <p>Even in relationships, you enjoy travel and outdoor activities, and you are likely to connect with partners who are physically distant.</p>
            <p>With high standards, you are cautious in choosing a spouse and seeks a refined and dignified form of love.</p>
            <p>In relationships you are proactive and passionate, but you must be cautious of the risk that a secret relationship may be exposed.</p>
            <p>You carry a strong fortune of reunion, with meetings and separations repeating, and you seek a partner with whom you can connect deeply on a mental level.</p>
            <p>Relationships of love and resentment that are hard to leave tend to form, making healthy distance essential. True love is completed only when each person's independence is respected rather than blaming one another's flaws.</p>
            <p>You may become emotionally over-immersed in your partner, leading to fixation or suspicion, so caution is required. You prioritize mental connection above all else, and it is important to meet someone who respects your need for solitude.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1rem;color:#001aff;margin-bottom:8px;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;padding-bottom:4px;">About Wealth</h2>
            <p>You have the ability to steadily accumulate assets through your own skills and generate practical profits by collaborating with people around you.</p>
            <p>Your income grows steadily through diligent effort, and with a good sense for financial management and investment, you are able to build assets in a stable and reliable way.</p>
            <p>You tend to spend as much as you earn, and are prone to becoming financially overextended (excess wealth with insufficient personal capacity). Careful asset management and strengthening financial foundations are essential over aggressive expansion.</p>
            <p>By managing regular income wisely, you steadily build stable wealth, and as your reputation grows, financial fortune naturally follows.</p>
            <p>You possess favorable inheritance fortune or document-related wealth, along with an outstanding ability to generate significant profits by leveraging intellectual assets.</p>
            <p>You have a stable financial flow in which assets grow through inheritance, gifts, or strong support from others. Rather than rapid accumulation of wealth, steadily nurtured assets gradually expand and provide reliable security in later life.</p>
            <p>Wealth comes in honestly in proportion to how much you move, and you have the fortune to earn large sums away from your hometown.</p>
            <p>Wealth comes as blessings granted by Heaven in proportion to your efforts, leading to a generally peaceful later life.</p>
            <p>Your finances tend to fluctuate with major losses followed by major gains, yet you are adept at businesses that leverage people.</p>
            <p>Your wealth follows a late-bloomer pattern, gradually accumulating as your talents bear fruit after middle age.</p>
