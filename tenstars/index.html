            <h2>What are the Ten Stars?</h2>
            <p>  In the network of the eight characters known as Saju-palja, the core concept that determines one's "social role" is Sipseong (The Ten Gods). Based on the Ilgan (the Self), the other characters are classified into ten different names depending on their relationship of generation or control (Saeng-Geuk). This serves as a map of how an individual interacts with the world and the values they pursue.</p>
            <p>  The Ten Stars are derived from the Five Elements, each split into a Yin and Yang pair, creating ten distinct archetypes. These archetypes don't exist in isolation—they form a dynamic ecosystem within your chart, where some stars support your goals while others create necessary friction for growth. Understanding which stars dominate your chart reveals not just your personality, but the fundamental strategy through which you navigate life.</p>

        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>Companion &amp; Rob Wealth (BG / GJ)</h2>
            <p>  First, Bigyeon (the Friend) and Geobjae (the Robber) share the same element as the Self, representing self-esteem, independence, and competitiveness. A strong Bigyeon points to a clear sense of subjectivity and an independent streak, while a well-developed Geobjae manifests as a fierce competitive spirit and the drive to overwhelm others. In modern society, these serve as the fundamental strength needed to build one's personal brand and survive in a competitive landscape.</p>
            <p>  When balanced, these stars produce confidence without arrogance—a healthy self-respect that allows you to stand firm under pressure. However, an excess of Bigyeon or Geobjae without the tempering influence of other stars can lead to stubbornness, difficulty compromising, or a tendency to see everything as a zero-sum competition. The key is whether this self-oriented energy is channeled toward constructive independence or destructive rivalry.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>Eating God &amp; Hurting Officer (SS / SG)</h2>
            <p>  Siksin (the Eating God) and Sang-gwan (the Hurting Officer) represent the energy you output into the world. They signify the activity of expressing your talents and giving to others, and are commonly interpreted as one's "blessing for food" (livelihood) or expressive ability. A well-developed Siksin highlights a specialized expertise—the ability to dig deep into one subject—whereas a strong Sang-gwan indicates exceptional wit and quick thinking, allowing one to stand out in the arts or oratory. Within a Saju chart, these act as the driving forces that generate wealth.</p>
            <p>  People with prominent Siksin energy often find fulfillment in teaching, cooking, craftsmanship, or any field where patient mastery is rewarded. Those with strong Sang-gwan energy, meanwhile, tend to excel in debate, performance, writing, or entrepreneurship—anywhere that rewards quick adaptability and the courage to challenge conventions. The distinction between the two is subtle but important: Siksin builds quietly and deeply, while Sang-gwan disrupts boldly and publicly.</p>

        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>Wealth Stars (PJ / JJ)</h2>
            <p>  Jaeseong (Wealth/Reality) represents the results and outputs that you control and manage; it typically symbolizes material wealth and a sense of reality. While Jeong-jae (Proper Wealth) signifies meticulous management skills and stable assets, Pyeon-jae (Indirect Wealth) refers to a temperament for large-scale distribution or commanding broad spaces. Those with a well-developed Jaeseong are quick to grasp reality and possess a result-oriented mindset, often leading them to excel in economic activities.</p>
            <p>  It is worth noting that "wealth" in Saju extends beyond money. Jaeseong also governs your relationship with the tangible world—your ability to manage resources, maintain practical affairs, and stay grounded in reality. Someone with little Jaeseong may be brilliant in abstract thinking but struggle with financial planning, while someone with abundant Jaeseong naturally gravitates toward pragmatic solutions and measurable outcomes.</p>

        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>Officer Stars (PG / JG)</h2>
            <p>  Gwan-seong (Authority/Career) is the energy that regulates you and aligns you with a framework, symbolizing honor, organization, and a sense of responsibility. While Jeong-gwan (Proper Authority) represents a conservative tendency to uphold principles and order, Pyeon-gwan (Biased Authority) manifests as authoritative, explosive leadership or a drive for high-stakes prestige. Those with a well-placed Gwan-seong value social titles and status, achieving stable growth within organizational life.</p>
            <p>  In personal relationships, Gwan-seong also reflects your sense of duty and self-discipline. A well-placed Officer Star often indicates someone who takes commitments seriously, follows through on promises, and earns respect through reliability. Conversely, an excessive or poorly positioned Gwan-seong can manifest as rigidity, an overbearing need for control, or chronic stress from self-imposed standards that are impossibly high.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>Seal Stars (PI / JI)</h2>
            <p>  Lastly, In-seong (Input/Support) is the energy that generates and nurtures the self, representing study, qualifications, and receptivity. While Jeong-in (Proper Resource) signifies orthodox academic pursuits and recognized authority, Pyeon-in (Indirect Resource) refers to original ideas or technical intuition. Those with abundant In-seong possess great depth of thought, are skilled at drawing support from others, and show strength in knowledge-based activities.</p>
            <p>  The Seal Stars also govern the support systems in your life—mentors, teachers, parents, and institutions that nurture your development. A chart rich in In-seong suggests someone who benefits greatly from formal education, certifications, and established networks. Meanwhile, those with Pyeon-in often learn best through unconventional means: self-study, intuition, travel, or hands-on experimentation rather than traditional classrooms.</p>

        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>In this sense, the Sipseong (Ten Gods) does not classify energies as inherently "good" or "bad"; rather, it reveals which way your life force leans. By looking at the distribution of these ten characters, you can discern whether your chart is one that pursues wealth, prioritizes honor, or places self-expression above all else. Identifying which Sipseong manifests most strongly in your own Saju can provide much-needed clarity for the career paths or relationship struggles you are currently navigating.</p>
            <p>  Remember that no single star defines you entirely. A complete reading examines the interplay of all ten stars as they appear across your four pillars and shift through the cycles of Daewun (Decade Luck) and Sewun (Annual Luck). A Wealth Star that is dormant in your natal chart may roar to life when a favorable decade arrives, just as a dominant Officer Star may soften during a period ruled by Expression energy. The Ten Stars are not fixed labels—they are living forces whose influence waxes and wanes with the passage of time.</p>
