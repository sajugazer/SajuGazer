            <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 2026</p>
            <p>By accessing and using Sajugazer ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please do not use the Service. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Sajugazer regarding your use of the website located at sajugazer.com and all associated content and services.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>Description of Service</h2>
            <p>Sajugazer provides a free, browser-based Saju (Four Pillars of Destiny) chart calculation and analysis service. The Service allows users to generate a personalized Saju chart by entering their birth date, birth time, gender, and geographic location. Based on this input, the Service computes Four Pillars data and provides structured interpretations across multiple dimensions, including Total Analysis, Daily Fortune, Monthly Fortune, Yearly Fortune, and Decade Fortune.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the Service offers educational articles about Saju philosophy, concepts such as the Ten Stars (Sipseong), Fateful Stars (Sinsal), and the 12 Stages of Energy (Unseong), as well as an AI-ready prompt copy feature that allows users to export their chart data for use with external AI assistants. All computations are performed locally in your browser using client-side JavaScript. We do not require user registration, do not maintain user accounts, and do not collect or store personal birth data on any server.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">

If you are under 18, you should review these Terms with a parent or guardian before using the Service. If we learn that a user under 13 has accessed the Service in violation of this provision, we reserve the right to take appropriate measures as permitted by law.</p>
